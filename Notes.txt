- Make use of the semantic html elements for different parts of the web page.
<header>
<nav>
<main>
<aside>
<section>
<footer>

- whenever we are confused with the roles of the elements by their respresentation. we can make use of
their roles to use it in our elements
<header role="banner">
<div role="navigation">
<footer role="contentinfo">

- when we have multiple same landmarks like <navs> and multiple mains, we make use of the aria-label
in order to give a specific meaning and distinguish them.

- <aside> and section tag
<aside> is something is related to the main content, section is like a separate piece of block which 
which we keep some part of the content.
<aside aria-label="share the page"></aside>
<section aria-label="Newsletter"></section>

- Buttons and Links
the <button> element should be used for any interaction that performs an action on the current page.
The <a> element should be used for any interaction that navigates to another view.

clicking "company" opens a drop-down menu. This is the interaction that performs an action on the
current page. Using <button> here is the correct thing to do. The underlying links, about us, our offerings
and so on, are correctly coded with <a> elements.

Semantic HTML gives context to screen readers, which read the contents of the page out loud.

Should not use div why?
- Buttons have more suitable styling by default.
- A screen reader identifies it as a button.
- It is focusable
- it is Clickable.

Links - Links are used to take users from one page to another.For a link to be accessible, remember to
- use the href attribute to sepcify the link destination.
- use a proper url in the href attribute. The url can be absolute or relative.

<a href="https://www.google.com">This is a link</a>

=========================================================================================

Accesibility Role, Name and Value

Role - For exmaple just like buttons and links, we are not allowed to use the button in the componnet and 
we need to make use of the <a> tag then we will specify the role as Button in that.
Now, the assitive technologies can understand that it is a button.

Name - Whenever we are using the dropdown and the input there will not any distinction between the 
dropdown and the input. The drop-down will be coded as select which is a correct element for this case,
But, when we use this name:
<select name="countryCode">Provide your country</select>
This cannot be used by assitive technologies / it will not help any users.
so we should make use of the aria-label
<select aria-label="country calling code" name="country code">...</select>

Value - In case of components like accordion, whether the accordion is open/closed, This needs to be
accessible.
An accordion is a custom component. There is no standard HTML element to use here.
Each accordion header should be a <button> or role="button", and to tell its closed, we put it as below

<div role="button" aria-expanded="false">Whne do i get Charged for a ride</div>

=========================================================================================

Accessibility color contrast

Text and graphical components on a web page need good contrast so that we can make sure that it is
perceivable by users. some of users have the reduced vision.
We measure the contrast between the text/graphics against the background color, this is called the contrast
ratio.
Minimum contrast ration should be checked using the contrast ratio and also, and depends like apple
needs just 4.

Color contrast needs to be updated for the unfocused or foused state and is atleast 3.

=============================================================================================

Accesibility color alone as a meaning

we need to keep the underlined on the link and do not remove them: since they will increase the readability
of the content:
============================================================================================

Accesibility Meanigful and Decorative images

Some images are meaningful and some are decorative.Every image must be coded as meanignful or decoartive.

Decorative images:
If am image is not community for a user to understand the functinality or the content of a web page or app
it is considered decorative.

The basic way to set an image as decorative is to use an empty alt attribute.

Whenever we have the few icons that can be used like four shortcuts, each has ab illustrative icon
we use the alt attribute

===================================================================================================

If we have the five links that are combinators of icons and text (Home, feeds, Messaegner, cart)
Site is not readable , if we remove the icons they are decorative.
role="img" aria-hidden = "true"

<i class="navbar Icon" role="img" aria-hidden= "true"></i>

if you are using the svg image with the <img>element , you must add an emplty alt attribute.
SVG images are often inserted inline, using the svg elemnt and use the aria-hidden = "true" will
make your image decorative.

<svg aria-hidden="true"></svg>

====================================================================================
Descriptive alt attribute - The alt attribute provides an alt text for an iamge.
The reason can be a slow connection, an error with the image tile or if the user uses an scrrn reader.
The alt attribute should properly describe the image or even better.

the methods are same for the background image.

========================================================================================

Accesibility link states

A visited state can help a person with short term memory loss.
A hover state can reduce the muscle control.
A focused link can help the kwyboard users to know which link was clicked.


Link has many states and below are them:
- unvisited
- hover
- visited
- active
- focus

Underline - Links are underlined by default and removing the underline from the link in a body text
is a bad idea.
contrast and focus - orange outline has low contrast compared to the white background.
second, the lack of offset makes the text hard to read.
they used the css -properties like - outline-color and outline-offset.


hover - on hover text we can highlight the color and make the text bold to let the user know what actions
he is going to perform.

=========================================================================================

Accessibility link text
An accessible link text is a text that makes sense without any context. A link text should clearly 
explain what the user is going to do by clicking on that link.

Headings

People are the heading structure to scan the page, and get an understanding to the main content.
Headings are defined with <h1> to <h6>.

<h1> is used for main headings and <h2> headings, then less important <h3> and so on.
